## Architecture

MusicApp follows a **three-tier architecture** with a clear separation of concerns:

### Domain Layer
- Contains the core business entities (e.g., `AppUser`, `Song`, `Playlist`, `Friendship`, etc.).
- **Location:** `MusicApp.Domain` project

### Data Layer (Repository Pattern)
- Implements the Entity Framework Core DbContext and the generic repository pattern.
- All data access logic is encapsulated in the repositories.
- **Location:** `MusicApp.Data` project
- **Example:**  
  - `IRepository<T>` and `Repository<T>` are defined here.
  - EF Core mappings and composite key configurations are done in `AppDbContext.cs`.

### Business Layer
- Contains service classes that implement business logic and orchestrate repository calls.
- **Location:** `MusicApp.Business` project
- **Example:**  
  - `AccountService`, `PlaylistService`, etc., which handle user registration, login, and playlist management.

### Web API Layer
- An ASP.NET Core Web API project that exposes endpoints for the frontend.
- **Location:** `MusicApp.Web` project
- Utilizes JWT authentication, CORS, and Swagger for API documentation.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core (.NET 6/7)  
  - Entity Framework Core with a code‚Äëfirst approach
  - MySQL (using Pomelo EntityFrameworkCore.MySql)
  - Repository pattern for data access
  - JWT authentication

- **Frontend:** Angular 18  
  - Responsive UI for music listening and social interactions
  - Integration with the backend API
